I cannot believe that its been that long already. <img src='images/ludumdare24.PNG'> Sadly I cannot go into what my challenges actually are, but I can say that they&#39;ve kept me extremely busy this entire week and will be this weekend as well. After a quick trip to see my family for my Birthday tomorrow, it&#39;ll be back home to pack for my trip to Chicago.</p>",
