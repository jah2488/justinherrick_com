            <div><p>Whew! It has been a crazy week so far. This past Monday was the first official day of my challenges to wrap up my residency at 8th Light. I cannot believe that its been that long already. Sadly I cannot go into what my challenges actually are, but I can say that they&#39;ve kept me extremely busy this entire week and will be this weekend as well. After a quick trip to see my family for my Birthday tomorrow, it&#39;ll be back home to pack for my trip to Chicago.</p>

            <div><p>I was finishing up some clojure code in a command line application I&#39;m working on and thought that throwing some randomness into my color code would lead to lots of fun.</p>

            <p>I was correct, having a <strong>rainbow-print</strong> function leads to endless enjoyable when placed in the right areas. Although that was well and good, it wasn&#39;t very useful to everyone else as they&#39;d need the same base functions that I had in my project. So I had made a standalone version for anyone to use....</p>

            <div><p>I&#39;ve finally started to get into clojure this week after admiring it from afar for a long time. I know the history of the lisp dialects and I know what Clojure is, but I can honestly say I&#39;ve never attempted to actually write anything in it. Taking the jump from my ruby based OO world to that of a paren filled functional world seemed a little bit intimidating, but therein lies the thrill and some of the adventure. Learning a new family or style of language can teach you new ways to approach...</p>

          <div><p>So last Thursday was our iteration meeting and like our last several IPMs, it went very well. The team is getting really good at delivering a polished demo to the client. My only issue with the IPMs is that my remote status becomes a very obvious strain as I am normally unable to actually see whats going on (without significant delay) and hearing  one person in a room of 8 talking is extremely difficult. For the sake of the IPM, it means I tend to take a back seat during the meeting, which is...</p>

            <div><p>Yesterday I spent the full day remotely pairing with Patrick on a large story for this iteration. Due to our remote situation we paired by screen sharing through ichat and talked through the process. It seemed to work pretty well, the only issue we ran into was that the lag always left one of us slightly behind and looking at a blurry string. We compensated for this and instead of having us constantly switch who was driving back and forth we took much longer turns where I was driving up until...</p>

After spending some time pairing with Li-Hsuan on Friday morning, I spent waza finishing up my limelight TTT game. I know have a TTT game working from the console and through limelight and I found the refactoring to be interesting. Most of the changes I had to make were to make my methods more general. Even though I thought I had been keeping my methods adhering to the SRP, it seemed...</p>
